# OpenRGB X Pcap
The remake of (scapy-rgb)[https://github.com/p6nj/scapy-music/blob/main/SacpyRGB.py] in Rust a bit less easy-to-use but FAST (and resource friendly).
Note that the Python version was based on IPv4 addresses and this one uses only raw data.  
Try it on Linux using the script `auto-setup.sh`.
# TODO
- Performance improvement using temporary matrix
- Windows compatibility testing
